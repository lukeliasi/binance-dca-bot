## v2.0.0 breaking changes

Version `2.0.0` drops supports to `config.js` configuration file in favor of `.env` file or Environment Variables.
New `trades.js` now supports all the required settings to perform crypto trades (same format as before), separating sensitive data (api keys, connection strings, emails) from the non-sensitive one (crypto pairs).
All other settings (API/Telegram/SendGrid/MongoDB/...) needs to be set using Environment Varaibles or `.env` file.

## Setup

### Generate API keys

[Create a new API key on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072). You should select **Enable Reading** and **Enable Spot & Margin Trading** for the restrictions.

![Binance API](/images/api.png)

**NB:** be aware that API permissions will last for 90 days, after that period you need to set permissions again. This is a Binance security feature to prevent API to be generated and forgotten active.

### Create the project

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v13 or higher required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukeliasi/binance-dca-bot.git
cd binance-dca-bot
npm install
```

## Configure the bot

All the required settings needs to be set using Environment Variables or `.env` file. The trades you want to make can be configured in a `trades.js` file in the root or with environment variables.

Rename the `env.example` to `.env` file for a quick bootstrap.

### Trades.js file

Configure the `trades.js` file in the root, you can uncomment and edit the provided example file.

**NB:** you may also define trades as an Environment Variables (see section below).

#### Trades object

## Running the bot

Use this command to start the bot: `npm run start`. The program must stay running, and it will execute the buy orders at the defined schedules using cron jobs.

### Alternative: Using Docker

You can also build a **Docker** image of the bot and run it without having to install Node.js. To do that, and assuming [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed, first build the image:

```
docker build -t binance-dca-bot .
```

then you can execute it with:

```
docker run -v $PWD/trades.js:/app/trades.js binance-dca-bot
```

## Telegram integration

This bot has a built-in Telegram integration that just needs to be configured.

First of all you need to create your personal Telegram Bot, we do not provide any public bot because it will then needs maintenance and/or accessing minimal personal informations.

*Do it yourself and stay safe* ðŸ˜Ž.

### Create the bot

Telegram has an easy way to create bots, it really just takes a couple of steps.

1. Open `Telegram` and search for `BotFather` chat
2. Eventually start the bot and run the `/newbot` command
3. Enter the `name` you want to use for the bot
4. Enter the `username` for the bot (it must ends with `bot`)
5. Done!

![Telegram Bot Setup](/images/telegram-bot.png)

In the last message you can find the `HTTP API` token that you need to use. **Store it securely and do not share with anyone**.

> **That string needs to be placed in the `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` environment variable.**

### Start the bot

After you created the bot just search for it and send any dummy message. It can be anything, you just need to send some data to the bot for the next step.

### Get the chat id

Open the browser and navigate to this url:

> `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates`

Replace `<token>` with the HTTP API from previous step, do not remove `bot` at the beginning of the string.

If you have done everything right it will reply with a JSON containing some informations (this is a simplified version where we removed useless info).

```json
{
 "ok": true,
 "result": [
  {
   "update_id": 123456789,
   "message": {
    "message_id": 123,
    "from": {
     "id": XXXXXXXX,
     "is_bot": false,
     "first_name": "Jon",
     "last_name": "Doe",
     "username": "jondoe",
     "language_code": "en"
    },
    "date": 1637489677,
    "text": "hello there",
   }
  }
 ]
}
```

What we really need is the chat id located in:

`result->message->from->id`

> **That string need to be placed in the `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` environment variable.**

That's all we needs to have Telegram notifications when the bot starts or performs trades.

![Telegram Bot Messages](/images/telegram-bot-messages.png)

**NB:** if you're adding the bot to a `Group Chat` the process is a bit different but there are easy-to-use bots that helps you retrieve the chat id such as [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot), remember to kick it after you get what you need (just in case).

## MongoDB integration

All the trades can also be saved on a MongoDB collection for further analysis.
For ease of use we strongly suggest the free tier of Mongo Atlas, more than enough for this bot.

![MongoDB Atlas](images/mongodb-atlas.png)

### Create the database

To get things ready you need to follow these steps:

1. Create an account (or login) to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)
2. If you're new to Atlas you'll need to create an `Organization`
3. Create a new project
4. Add a Free (`Shared / M0 Sandbox`) database to it. Here you can select the provider and server location, this may vary depending on you actual location. Give it a recognizable name, just for better understanding.
5. Select to use the username and password authentication method (do not use same username and password as the main account)
6. Select the `Cloud Environment` connection.
7. If you bot host is providing a public IP address then fill it in the form, otherwise you need to give access to anyone using the `0.0.0.0/0` IP ranges

### Get connection string

You need to connect the bot with the database using a connection string.
To retrieve that follow these steps:

1. In the `databases` screen, click on `Connect` on the desired cluster
2. Select `Connect your application`
3. Copy the connection string and use it in the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.

![MondoDb Connection String](/images/mongodb-connection.png)

**NB:** you need to replace `<password>` with your actual database account password (created on step 5).

## Deployment

Consider running the bot in the cloud, so you do not need to run the bot constantly on your machine.

Some options:

- [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8944587-8H) - $100 free credit using link
- [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/4f3661af7d87) - $100 free credit using link
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

You will want to use [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) process manager or similar on the server which keeps the bot running and can restart the bot automatically if the server or program crashes.

Remember the remote server may be in a different timezone to you, run the command `date` to see the servers timezone to configure your cron accordingly.

**NB:** If you are using Heroku, the free tier is enough for this bot. Please consider to use [Kaffeine](https://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/) to keep the bot awake.

## Automating fiat deposits to Binance

For further automation you can deposit funds into your Binance account automatically via bank transfer. Simply initiate a fiat deposit (bank transfer) via the Binance website and note down the bank details you need to pay to. The reference code and other details never change, so you can set up a standing order with your bank to automatically transfer money to Binance on a schedule with these details.

As an exmaple, you could set up a standing order to deposit to Binance the day after you get paid, and then configure the bot to purchase your crypto the following day.
